RelayBoard v2

schematic changes
- maybe use a smaller cheaper eth port without integrated magnetics?
  - already have them might as well keep them
- remove the weird connectors on the bottom, and just add some jst connectors along the sides
- add 24V to 5V based on ian's design
  - battery level indicator lights or something? using voltage divider and analog read
    - What was the allowable range again? 21.6-25.2? 22-26?
      - https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/9dbno3/lm3914_voltage_indicator_with_high_voltage/
        - dot mode. can we use lower power?
- add xt60 power connector option
  - cad a custom fire retardant metal lv battery enclosure around it?
    - no
  - put it at the opposite edge as the ethernet ports, with 6 jst connectors along the sides
- add a few indicator leds to debug with
  - stm32 should have very good debugging capabilities right
- add more decoupling caps in various places around the board
- add accelerometer + laser sensor connector + plug into spacex arduino? :P
  - different grounding method required
- use a more standard SD card reader lol

meh schematic changes
- add wireless capabilities?? meh unlikely to be useful
- maybe use atsam3x8e instead? meh...
  - add a 16U2 for usb flashing lol
  - maybe i should just use the regular atmega2560 if i'm going for accessibility,
    and just add separate W5100 and canbus controllers over SPI.
  - but that probably doesn't fit in an Uno shield form factor, especially if i'm only using the top.
  - meh whatever, the atsam3x8e probably doesn't fit either lol

layout changes
- arduino shield shape
  - but add something fun. How badly can i artistically mangle the edge and still have it structurally stable / manufacturable?
  - plated keychain hole :P
- no more vias through footprints
- have a better mounting and grounding system
- have actual silkscreen so i can solder stuff more easily
- use 4 layer board, gnd and vcc in the middle
  - should i put the signal lines in the middle of the stackup? will they interfere with each other more?
  - just leave gnd and vcc in the middle so you can see the traces :P
- use the horizontal/vertical signal routing method
- set all the via and track settings to jlcpcb's minimums
- use dogbone for the bga
- leave all the components on the top. much easier to deal with mechanically this way
  - except maybe the sd card.

assembly
- toaster oven reflow
  - LOTS of test points on the bottom of the board to verify BGA success
- what solder paste should i get?
- get this soldering iron https://www.amazon.com/UY-CHAN-Programmable-Pocket-size-Acceleration/dp/B06XBFTKMY
- use stencil from jlcpcb
  - can change footprints from handsolder to regular

misc
- get design roasted by chawthri, linda, ian, connor
- is there any way i can do smaller scale testing of this thing? like connecting breakout boards on a breadboard.
  - or ordering a bunch of small boards that can be connected manually
